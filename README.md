# Sanyam Brar

My personal site, plus a pile of small games and tools. It ships as static files, but navigation still feels like one app.

**[Live site](https://itsmesamey.github.io/)** · [Work](https://itsmesamey.github.io/work/) · [Writing](https://itsmesamey.github.io/blog/) · [Tools](https://itsmesamey.github.io/tools/)

## What's here

| | |
|---|---|
| **Games** | Wordle, Keybr, Chain Reaction |
| **Tools** | Live diff, Markdown preview, text inspector, encoders, converters |
| **Work** | Projects and open-source work |
| **Writing** | Notes and longer technical posts |

## Shape of the site

```text

      │
      ├── Site / Work / Writing / Projects
      ├── Tools + Monaco DiffEditor
      ├── Wordle
      ├── Keybr
      └── Chain Reaction
```

Most pages share the same shell for navigation, themes, search, transitions, context menus, and the custom cursor. Same-origin navigation swaps real page roots instead of using iframes.

The site, Wordle and the vendored Keybr port use Solid 2 RC and Vite. Keybr retains a small local API adapter for its ported components, not a React runtime. Larger editors and demos load only when opened.

Diff uses one editable Monaco DiffEditor. Monaco owns line alignment, gap zones, and character-level highlighting. It is used without dependency patches.

## Build

```sh
bun install --ignore-scripts --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
```

`docs/` is the deployable site.

Monaco is used as a normal pinned dependency; the repository does not patch or modify `node_modules` during install.

## Development and validation

Build once for the shared static assets, then use `bun run dev` for the site, `bun run dev:wordle`, or `bun run dev:keybr`. These serve on localhost ports 4320, 4321 and 4322 and use the production Vite compiler.

`bun run check` runs type checking, typed linting, the build, and Playwright tests. Tests use Chromium; an installed `/usr/bin/brave` is detected automatically, or set `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to your browser. Otherwise install Playwright's Chromium with `bunx playwright install chromium`.

Read [the migration report](SOLID_V2_MIGRATION.md) for exact RC pins, Kobalte's experimental peer mismatch, and the native replacements for incompatible dependencies.
